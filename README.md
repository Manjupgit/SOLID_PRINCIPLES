# SOLID_PRINCIPLES
There are five SOLID principles:  
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  : **A class should have only a single responsibility.** 
Open Closed Principle (OCP)  : **A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.**
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  : **A type must be substitutable by its subtypes without altering the correctness of the application.**
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) :   **Clients of a class should not be forced to depend on those of its methods that they don't use.**
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) : **1) High-level classes should not dependent on low-level classes. Both of them should depend on abstractions.
**2) Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.**
